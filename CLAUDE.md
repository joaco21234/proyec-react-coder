### Analysis Summary

I need more information to understand your request. Please tell me what you would like to know or do. For example, you could ask:

*   "What is the overall architecture of the system?"
*   "How does the user authentication process work?"
*   "Show me the code for the `login` function."
*   "What are the main components of the payment module?"

Once you provide a clear query, I can assist you by analyzing the codebase and generating a report.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Need for More Information**
   The system indicates that it needs more information to understand the user's request. It provides examples of clear queries that it can assist with, such as asking about the overall architecture, user authentication, specific functions, or main components of a module.
